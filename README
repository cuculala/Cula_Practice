Fall Sophomore Computer Science Students led By Jessica Mong convened together to learn coding extravanga of new languages such as Ruby, Python.

This is the example project that Jessica helped us create in Python.

It was great start for the to-be programmers at Claflin University. I am delighted that I attended the session.

At the time of completition, the code was working.
